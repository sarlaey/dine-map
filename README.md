# Getting started

First, clone the repo :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Angus-Paillaugue/
cd
```

Then, copy the `.env` file :

```bash
mv .env.example .env
```

You can now set strong variables for the `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` if you want.
If you are running the frontend behind a web

## With custom self-hosted tiles

You first need to generate the tiles.
To do so, open [.env](.env) and set the `TILE_CUSTOM` to true, `TILES_CONTINENT` to the continent you want to download the tiles, and optionally (it's heavily recommended), set `TILES_COUNTRY` to the country of your choosing.

Then run the generation script

```bash
./scripts/customTiles/all.sh
```

This script will download and process the tiles of the area you choose previously.

> [!WARNING]
> This ca be a long and intensive process.
> The resulting file can be weigh then's of Gb

Once finished, you should have a file called [tileset/tiles.mbtiles](tileset/tiles.mbtiles). This will be used by the file server to render the map tiles with the custom matching styles.

You can now run everything :

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## With cloud tiles

This is the simple version of running the project, it just involves setting `TILE_CUSTOM` to `false` in [.env](.env)

You can now just start the webserver and database and it's done!

```bash
docker compose up db web -d
```
